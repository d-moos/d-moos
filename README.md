### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior engineer currently transitioning from C# to Rust 

C# / .NET:
- [SmoldotNET](https://github.com/PolkadotNET/SmoldotNet/tree/master/SmoldotNET) a .NET WebAssembly host implementation for the [Polkadot smoldot lightclient](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot)
- [SuiNet](https://github.com/d-moos/SuiNet) is a .NET SDK for the SUI Blockchain
- the [Move Binary Reader](https://github.com/d-moos/move-binary-format-reader) parses a compiled Move (.mv) file 
- the [Vault](https://github.com/naami-finance/vault-mono) is a backend mono-repo for a SUI dApp. It consists of a graphQL layer as well as a chain indexer

Rust:
- [silkrust](https://github.com/d-moos/silkrust) is a general purpose library that helps building SR_Modules with ease. It handles all network and security related topics.
- [Toy Payment Engine](https://github.com/d-moos/payment_engine) is a simple payment engine implementation in Rust that accepts an input transaction file (provided as an .csv) and outputs the final clients and their balance.
